# Welcome to our recipe book!

We are just two students trying to collaborate to make our lives and the lives of others a bit easier.

We had this great idea to share recipes with each other online and to allow us to do some basic meal planning.

We invite you to use these tools also to enjoy your meal preperation more.

While using this recipe book, you can do the same here and online.

The concept is a simple CRUD app for managing recipes. Images for your recipes may be stored in the cloud!

Enjoy image upload with Cloudinary (thus also being able to upload your own images), or link to images you like.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
